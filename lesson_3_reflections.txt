When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would use a remote repository if I wanted to work remotely on a project from a non-personal computer or when
I'm working with a another person(s).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pull changes manually allows me to have control on changes I'm happy with, and/or changes other collaborators may make. 
Since I'm the expert on the project, I'll refrain Git from automatically staying up to date since I would know best
which commits will be best for project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks can ONLY be used on Github. Github allows you fork an existing code and duplicate or 'fork' the copy
to your repository. Clones are copies of an original code, however, clones can be copied/duplicated into 
another repository (whether its local or remote). Branches are commit histories of projects, in the form 
of master and supporting/experimental branches.
