What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialized a repository, Git will track the commits I'll be making. However, since there is no history to track by default its at 0. I need Git to track any changes/commits I'll be making. So far, my reflections text prior to setting up the repository was not tracked, so there is no history of changes recorded. Now with Git, it's now being tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging allows me to track the history of all my changes/commits without submitting to the respository. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area allows me to review my changes and decide what changes I'm happy with. I'll git status to see what's in the staging area,
and review if these are new changes different from whats in the repository and then commit my changes.
